/// OSSA lifetime completion adds lifetime ending instructions to make
/// linear lifetimes complete.
///
/// Completion is bottom-up recursive over nested borrow scopes. Additionally,
/// this may be extended to support dependent owned lifetimes in the future to
/// handle owned non-escaping values.
///
/// Lexical lifetimes can only be incomplete as a result of dead-end blocks. In
/// this case, their lifetime ends immediately before the dead-end block.
///
/// Nonlexical lifetimes can be incomplete for any reason. Their lifetime ends
/// at the liveness boundary.
